# TVS Default Risk Predictor
## Introduction

This project was developed to gain experience with ML using real-world data, and serves as a feasibility analysis of using ML with vehicle loan and customer information from TVS - a large Indian motorcycle company. The raw data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sjleshrac/tvs-loan-default) and is sourced from [Kaggle.com](www.kaggle.com). Our project addresses the concern of cross-selling personal loans to existing auto loan customers who are possible default risks, because personal loans are unsecured and therefore carry a relatively high cost for the provider if a default occurs. Using ML, a subset of the current vehicle loan customer base could be selected that only includes customers unlikely to default on a personal loan, thus reducing the risk to the personal loan provider (in this particular case, TVS Credit).
